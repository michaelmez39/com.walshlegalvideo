Whether it is a Day In The Life or a settlement documentary, we don't simply make videos.  We create broadcast quality productions that are full of feeling.  Our videos take you out of the mediation room and put you into the lives of your clients:  their homes, their families and their struggles.  The result is powerful.</p>
